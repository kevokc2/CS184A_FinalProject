UBC Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification (UBC-OCEAN)
-------------------------
By Brandon Lo, Maitreyi Sinha, Kevin Lee

About
-------------------------
This is our final project for CS184A on ovarian cancer subtype classification, which uses a dataset of microscopy images
provided by UBC (the host of the Kaggle competition). Our model uses a ResNet-50 architecture to be trained on the given data
and evaluated by its accuracy.

How to Use Data and Run
-------------------------
Due to the immense size of the dataset, this project is most easily ran by using a registered Kaggle account and running this notebook 
on Kaggle. This allows quick access to the provided data and usage for the model. Otherwise, trying to download the dataset and run separately 
will take an extremely prolonged amount of time.
